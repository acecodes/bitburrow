# [The Code Engine][1]

This web app translates any string of characters (numbers or letters) into Morse code. For the moment, it only translates one way (normal text -> Morse), but decoding will be implemented soon.

It runs on Flask and is deployed to Heroku. Styling is courtesy of Jinja (templating system), Boostrap (CSS) and WTForms (form element).
