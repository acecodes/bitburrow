# [The Code Engine][1]

This web app translates any string of characters (numbers, letters and punctuation marks) into Morse code or translates a Morse code message into English.

It runs on Flask and is deployed to Heroku. Styling is courtesy of Jinja (templating system), Boostrap (CSS) and WTForms (form element).
